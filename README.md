- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheEagle2050 or Bailey Sweeney
- 👀 I’m interested in AI/machine learning and how its advancements can help the processes of people. I like the idea of the merging of nature and technology, although its not at all my only focus, not just in the environmental-sense but also biologically. We don't want technology to overgrow nature, we want it to grow along side it and compliment it. My current educational and career goals involve getting a Masters of Science in Computer Science and improving my usage and analysis of data so that I can one day, hopefully, become a successful ML Engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL to better my interactions with databases. I have taken introductory courses in Java and Python and am looking to soon focus my mathematical knowledge towards Applied Statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects right now to expand my resume and skillset.
- 📫 How to reach me: I prefer to be emailed at baileymsweeney@gmail.com. I'll get back to you during the next 24 hours.
