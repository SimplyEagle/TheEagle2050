- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheEagle2050
- 👀 I’m interested in AI/machine learning and how its advancements can help the processes of people. I like the idea of the merging of nature and technology, not just in the environmental-sense but also biologically. We don't want technology to overgrow nature, we want it to grow along side it and compliment it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java but really want to expand my base knowledge and am excited for it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects right now to expand my resume and skillset.
- 📫 How to reach me: I prefer to be emailed at baileymsweeney@gmail.com. I'll get back to you during the next 24 hours.
