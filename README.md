- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheEagle2050 or Bailey Sweeney
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science/Machine Learning and how its advancements can help the processes of people. I like the idea of the merging of nature and technology. However, we don't want technology to overtake nature, we want it to grow along side it and compliment it. In the end, I would love to work with a renewable energy focused company as it is becoming more and more important, but also, neglected by the day. My current educational and career goals involve getting a Masters of Science in Computer Science(currently working on my Bachelor's) and improving my usage and analysis of data so that I can one day, hopefully, I can become a successful ML Engineer and make a small, but measurable change in the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better interact with databases. I am intermediate at Java programming and have shifting my focus toward Python and its librabies as they are invaluable to the the field of Computer Applied Statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects right now to expand my resume and skillset.
- 📫 How to reach me: I prefer to be emailed at baileymsweeney@gmail.com. I'll most likelyy get back to you during the next 24 hours.
